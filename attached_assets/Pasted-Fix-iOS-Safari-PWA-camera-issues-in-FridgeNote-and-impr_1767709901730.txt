Fix iOS Safari/PWA camera issues in FridgeNote and improve the capture UX.

CONTEXT
- iPhone Safari/PWA: user taps Start Camera, grants permission, iOS shows red privacy indicator but the in-app camera preview does not appear and user cannot take a photo.
- We are using getUserMedia and rendering a <video> preview in client/src/components/camera-capture.tsx.

GOALS
1) Make camera preview reliably show on iOS Safari and iOS “Add to Home Screen” (PWA).
2) Improve UX: Make the “Tap camera button to start” text area and the main hero image/placeholder clickable to start the camera, not just the Start Camera button.
3) Do not add new libraries. Keep TypeScript correct.

FILE TO EDIT
- client/src/components/camera-capture.tsx

REQUIRED CAMERA FIXES (iOS SAFE)
A) Ensure the <video> element uses iOS-safe attributes:
   - playsInline
   - muted
   - autoPlay
   (in JSX and/or programmatically)

B) After setting videoRef.current.srcObject = stream:
   - explicitly call await videoRef.current.play()
   - set playsinline attribute programmatically as well:
     video.setAttribute("playsinline", "true")

C) Relax facingMode constraints (environment camera can fail on iOS):
   - Use facingMode: { ideal: "environment" } not "environment"
   - Include width/height ideals (optional)
   - Implement fallback: if getUserMedia with constraints fails, retry with { video: true, audio: false }

D) Ensure stream stops on unmount and when user stops camera:
   - cleanup useEffect that stops all tracks
   - stopCamera() stops tracks and clears srcObject

E) If camera cannot start, show a clear error message and offer the file upload fallback.

UX IMPROVEMENTS
1) Add a prominent “Tap to start camera” clickable area:
   - Make the hero/placeholder area a button or clickable container.
   - Clicking it should call startCamera() (same function as Start Camera).
   - Keep accessibility: use <button type="button"> or role="button" + keyboard support.

2) Ensure the UI state changes clearly:
   - Before camera start: show “Tap to start camera” and Start Camera button.
   - After camera start: show live preview and a clear “Take photo” (capture) button.
   - Do NOT show recording mode; we only take a still frame from the video.

ACCEPTANCE TESTS (must pass)
- On iPhone Safari:
  - Tap the placeholder area -> permission prompt appears -> after Allow, a live camera preview appears.
  - “Take photo” button captures and proceeds to OCR as before.
- On iPhone after “Add to Home Screen”:
  - Same behaviour: preview appears and capture works.
- If camera fails:
  - Show error + allow upload image as fallback.
- Clicking the text/hero area starts camera.

OUTPUT
- Update camera-capture.tsx accordingly.
- Summarize changes and mention the exact iOS-specific fixes you applied (playsInline, play(), constraint fallback).
